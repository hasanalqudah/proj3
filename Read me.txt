proj3.py, contain the modules for 5 classifiers algorithms.
To run the program it should run form proj3.py


************ Instructions ***
Run main
The program will ask you to choose 2 datasets to classify
Key in 1 for Digit dataset
Key in 2 for Activity Recognition
Key 3 to enter the path or URL of data file

Note: you can use option three to run activity Recognition by specifying the data path in your local machine
